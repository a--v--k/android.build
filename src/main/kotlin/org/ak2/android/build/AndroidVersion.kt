     *  *  2d drawing hardware acceleration is now turned on by default.
     * You can use
     * [configurators:hardwareAccelerated][android.R.attr.hardwareAccelerated]
     * to turn it off if needed, although this is strongly discouraged since
     * it will result in poor performance on larger screen devices.
     *  *  The default theme for applications is now the "device default" theme:
     * [android.R.style.Theme_DeviceDefault]. This may be the
     * holo dark theme or a different dark theme defined by the specific device.
     * The [android.R.style.Theme_Holo] family must not be modified

     * request a theme from the Holo family will be guaranteed that these themes
     * will not change character within the same platform version. Applications
     * that wish to blend in with the device should use a theme from the
     * [android.R.style.Theme_DeviceDefault] family.
     *  *  Managed cursors can now throw an exception if you directly close
     * the cursor yourself without stopping the management of it; previously failures
     * would be silently ignored.
     *  *  The fadingEdge attribute on views will be ignored (fading edges is no
     * longer a standard part of the UI).  A new requiresFadingEdge attribute allows
     * applications to still force fading edges on for special cases.
     *  *  [Context.bindService()][android.content.Context.bindService]
     * will not automatically add in [android.content.Context.BIND_WAIVE_PRIORITY].

     * them, rather than relying on the padding being baked into the widget itself.
     *  *  An exception will be thrown if you try to change the type of a
     * window after it has been added to the window manager.  Previously this
     * would result in random incorrect behavior.

     * XML attributes that are defined.

     *
     *  * [Background execution limits]({@docRoot}about/versions/oreo/background.html)
     * are applied to the application.
     *  * The behavior of AccountManager's
     * [android.accounts.AccountManager.getAccountsByType],
     * [android.accounts.AccountManager.getAccountsByTypeAndFeatures], and
     * [android.accounts.AccountManager.hasFeatures] has changed as documented there.
     *  * [android.app.ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo.IMPORTANCE_PERCEPTIBLE_PRE_26]
     * is now returned as
     * [android.app.ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo.IMPORTANCE_PERCEPTIBLE].
     *  * The [android.app.NotificationManager] now requires the use of notification
     * channels.
     *  * Changes to the strict mode that are set in
     * [Application.onCreate] will no longer be clobbered after
     * that function returns.
     *  * A shared library apk with native code will have that native code included in
     * the library path of its clients.
     *  * [Context.getSharedPreferences][android.content.Context.getSharedPreferences]
     * in credential encrypted storage will throw an exception before the user is unlocked.
     *  * Attempting to retrieve a [Context.FINGERPRINT_SERVICE] on a device that
     * does not support that feature will now throw a runtime exception.
     *  * [android.app.Fragment] will stop any active view animations when
     * the fragment is stopped.
     *  * Some compatibility code in Resources that attempts to use the default Theme
     * the app may be using will be turned off, requiring the app to explicitly request
     * resources with the right theme.
     *  * [ContentResolver.notifyChange][android.content.ContentResolver.notifyChange] and
     * [ ContentResolver.registerContentObserver][android.content.ContentResolver.registerContentObserver]
     * will throw a SecurityException if the caller does not have permission to access
     * the provider (or the provider doesn't exit); otherwise the call will be silently
     * ignored.
     *  * [ CameraDevice.createCaptureRequest][android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice.createCaptureRequest]
     *  will enable [android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest.CONTROL_ENABLE_ZSL] by default for
     * still image capture.
     *  * WallpaperManager's [android.app.WallpaperManager.getWallpaperFile],
     * [android.app.WallpaperManager.getDrawable],
     * [android.app.WallpaperManager.getFastDrawable],
     * [android.app.WallpaperManager.peekDrawable], and

     * if you can not access the wallpaper.
     *  * The behavior of
     * [UsbDeviceConnection.requestWait][android.hardware.usb.UsbDeviceConnection.requestWait]
     * is modified as per the documentation there.
     *  * [StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder.detectAll]
     * will also enable [StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder.detectContentUriWithoutPermission]
     * and [StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder.detectUntaggedSockets].
     *  * [StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder.detectAll]
     * will also enable [StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder.detectUnbufferedIo].
     *  * [android.provider.DocumentsContract]'s various methods will throw failure
     * exceptions back to the caller instead of returning null.
     *  * [View.hasFocusable] now includes auto-focusable views.
     *  * [android.view.SurfaceView] will no longer always change the underlying
     * Surface object when something about it changes; apps need to look at the current
     * state of the object to determine which things they are interested in have changed.
     *  * [android.view.WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY] must be
     * used for overlay windows, other system overlay window types are not allowed.
     *  * [ ViewTreeObserver.addOnDrawListener][android.view.ViewTreeObserver.addOnDrawListener]
     *  will throw an exception if called from within onDraw.
     *  * [Canvas.setBitmap][android.graphics.Canvas.setBitmap] will no longer preserve
     * the current matrix and clip stack of the canvas.
     *  * [ListPopupWindow.setHeight][android.widget.ListPopupWindow.setHeight]

     *  * [android.widget.TextView] will use internationalized input for numbers,
     * dates, and times.
     *  * [android.widget.Toast] must be used for showing toast windows; the toast
     * window type can not be directly used.
     *  * [WifiManager.getConnectionInfo][android.net.wifi.WifiManager.getConnectionInfo]
     * requires that the caller hold the location permission to return BSSID/SSID
     *  * [WifiP2pManager.requestPeers][android.net.wifi.p2p.WifiP2pManager.requestPeers]
     * requires the caller hold the location permission.
     *  * [android.R.attr.maxAspectRatio] defaults to 0, meaning there is no restriction
     * on the app's maximum aspect ratio (so it can be stretched to fill larger screens).
     *  * [android.R.attr.focusable] defaults to a new state (`auto`) where it will
     * inherit the value of [android.R.attr.clickable] unless explicitly overridden.
     *  * A default theme-appropriate focus-state highlight will be supplied to all Views
     * which don't provide a focus-state drawable themselves. This can be disabled by setting
     * [android.R.attr.defaultFocusHighlightEnabled] to false.
